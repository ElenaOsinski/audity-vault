## 🌟 What Makes AudityVault Special?

AudityVault revolutionizes financial compliance through **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**, enabling organizations to submit sensitive audit data while maintaining complete privacy. Our platform ensures that even the most confidential financial information remains encrypted throughout the entire verification process.

### 🔐 Core Innovation

- **Zero-Knowledge Verification**: Verify compliance without exposing raw data
- **FHE-Powered Encryption**: Process encrypted data without decryption
- **Decentralized Trust**: Blockchain-based immutable audit trails
- **Privacy-First Design**: Your data, your control, always encrypted

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ and npm
- **Web3 Wallet** (MetaMask, Rainbow, etc.)
- **Sepolia ETH** for testnet interactions

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ElenaOsinski/audity-vault.git
cd audity-vault

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```env
# Blockchain Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=11155111
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=your_rpc_endpoint_here

# Wallet Integration
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here

# Contract Addresses (after deployment)

### Key Functions

```solidity
// Submit encrypted audit report
function submitAuditReport(
    address organization,
    string reportHash,
    string auditType,
    externalEuint32 riskScore,
    externalEuint32 complianceScore,
    externalEuint32 findingsCount,
    bytes inputProof
) external returns (uint256);

// Register new auditor
function registerAuditor(
    string name,
    string credentials,
    externalEuint32 initialReputation,
    bytes inputProof
) external returns (uint256);

// Verify audit report
function verifyAuditReport(uint256 reportId, bool isVerified) external;
```
